# End of Documentation

## Integration Points & Flows

Frontend → Backend: All user actions (repo submission, model selection, analysis requests) flow through API endpoints, which call services, models, and background tasks.
Background Processing: Analysis tasks run asynchronously, updating models and logs, and returning results via API.
Database & Vector Search: Models and services interact with SQLite, MongoDB, and ChromaDB for persistence and advanced analytics.
Logging & Error Handling: All modules log to code_evolution.log for traceability and debugging.

## Next Steps & Enhancement Roadmap (Expanded)

### Immediate Next Steps

- **Testing:** Add Pytest and coverage for all API endpoints, services, and background tasks; implement integration tests for multi-model analysis and repository flows.
- **Error Handling:** Refine exception handling in all service layers; add structured error responses and logging for API and background tasks.
- **Schema Validation:** Use Pydantic and OpenAPI for strict request/response validation; sync types with frontend for contract enforcement.
- **Documentation:** Add code samples for service manager, background tasks, and database flows; include architecture diagrams and async flowcharts.
- **Feature Flags:** Integrate environment-based toggles or a feature flag library for experimental analysis/model features.

### Feature Enhancements

- **Repository API:** Add bulk import, advanced filtering, and search by language, tech, commit count, and analysis status.
- **Multi-Model Analysis:** Support benchmarking, historical performance tracking, and consensus strategies; expose model metadata and usage stats via API.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implement WebSocket or SSE endpoints for live analysis progress, model status, and notifications.
- **Authentication:** Add OAuth/JWT-based authentication and role-based access control for sensitive endpoints and background tasks.
- **Performance/Security:** Expand analyzer modules with more granular metrics, reporting, and recommendations; add automated security scans and audit logs.
- **Pattern/Tech Tracking:** Use LLMs for advanced pattern detection and technology evolution analytics; expose historical analytics via API.
- **Export/Share:** Enable export of analysis results, logs, and metrics to JSON, CSV, PDF; add endpoints for report generation.

### Architectural Improvements

- **Service Layer:** Modularize services for easier extension; use dependency injection for testability and scalability.
- **Background Tasks:** Refactor orchestration for reliability (Celery, RQ, or native async queues); add monitoring and retry logic.
- **Database:** Optimize queries, indexing, and migrations for large repositories; add health checks and backup flows.
- **Type Safety:** Sync types with frontend using OpenAPI or codegen; enforce strict types in all models, schemas, and API responses.

### Documentation & Developer Experience

- **Onboarding:** Add setup guides, workflow diagrams, and coding standards; provide sample PRs and code review checklists.
- **Troubleshooting:** Document common errors, debugging tips, and recovery flows; add FAQ and support contact info.
- **Roadmap:** Maintain a public roadmap and changelog; use GitHub Projects or similar for feature tracking and prioritization.
